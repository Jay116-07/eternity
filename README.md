bypass Reddit's 1000-item listing limits by externally storing your Reddit items (saved, created, upvoted, downvoted, hidden) in your own database. new items are automatically synced so you'll never lose your Reddit data again

additional functionality: search for items, filter by subreddit, bulk export data
