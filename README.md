bypass Reddit's 1000-item listing limits by externally storing your Reddit items (saved, created, upvoted, downvoted, hidden) in your own personal database. new items are automatically synced so you'll never lose your Reddit data again

- additional functionality::
	- search for items
	- filter by subreddit
	- import csv data from [Reddit data request](https://www.reddit.com/settings/data-request)
	- export data as json
