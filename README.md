bypass Reddit's 1000-item listing limits by externally storing your Reddit items (saved, created, upvoted, downvoted, hidden) in your own database

- features::
	- uses your own Firebase database (your Reddit items are never stored on eternity's server)
	- new items offline auto-sync
	- search for items
	- filter by subreddit
	- unsave/delete/unvote/unhide items from Reddit directly on eternity
	- import csv data from [Reddit data request](https://www.reddit.com/settings/data-request)
	- export data as json
- demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ts7fO9wCuI0
